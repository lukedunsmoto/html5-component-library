## About

This project is a growing collection of clean, reusable HTML components you can copy, adapt, and use in real projects without heavy frameworks or tooling.

It’s intended as:

- a reference for learning HTML patterns
- a starting point for front-end builds
- a lightweight alternative to UI Kits
